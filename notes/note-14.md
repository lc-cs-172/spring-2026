## `graphics.py`

The package `graphics.py` is a simple object oriented graphics library designed
to make it very easy for novice programmers to experiment with computer
graphics. It is pretty similar to the package you might have used in CS 171.

Documentation for this library is available through this URL
https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf.

### Install

To install `graphics.py` on your machine, type in a terminal:

```sh
pip3 install graphics-py
```

`pip3` is the Python package manager. It is used to install and to manage
libraries such `graphics.py`, `PIL`, and `numpy`.

If successful, the last line of the installation status should say (the specific
version might be different for you):

```
Successfully installed graphics-py-5.0.1.post1
```

The package may already be installed, in which case, `pip3` might say:

```
Requirement already satisfied: graphics-py in ./.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages (5.0.1.post1)
```

The system may also notify you that a new version of `pip3` is available along
with the command you can use to update the package manager. You may follow its
suggestion:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
