# Assignment #1: CodingBat Warmup

This assignment is meant to give you some practice writing simple Python code,
very similar to the C code you wrote in CS 171.

Go to https://codingbat.com/python. Create an account (so you can track your
progress and your answers won't be deleted when you log out) and do the
following 13 problems:

* All the problems (6) in the
  [String-2 section](https://codingbat.com/python/String-2)
* All the problems (6) in the
  [List-2 section](https://codingbat.com/python/List-2)
* The *first* problem in the
  [Logic-2 section](https://codingbat.com/prob/p118406) (i.e., the `make_brick`
  problem)

## Hints

You will know how to do most of this stuff (because things like `if` statements
work exactly the same way in C and Java), but some things will be new (e.g.,
"How do I find the first character of a string?"). How are you supposed to
learn about these topics? You have several options:

* Consult [Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama#pythonorama)
* Use your favorite search engine
* Post questions to the [Google Classroom’s
  Stream](https://classroom.google.com/c/ODIwNjA3NDA2Mzc1)
* Ask questions in class
* Come to office hours
* Go to SQRC

Remember, the point is for you to practice solving these problems and patch any
gaps in your knowledge. If you run into trouble (e.g., you've been working on
one of these problems for ten minutes and have no idea how to proceed), ask for
help! The availability of help is the reason you (or someone) is paying for you
to go to college.

It's okay to ask other students, or a generative AI agent, questions as long as
they are along the lines of "How do I find the length of a list?" or "Can
somebody explain how `%` works?" and not "What is the complete solution to this
problem?" Pasting in someone else's solution is a waste of everyone's time and a
violation of academic integrity.

One thing you're going to need to know right away: these problems generally ask
you to return a value rather than printing it. We'll talk more about this when
we cover methods (functions) later in the class, but for now all you need to do
is use a `return` statement like:

```python
return x > 3
```

## What to hand in

Paste your answers (the entire contents of the code box on CodingBat) to the 13
assigned questions (`double_char`, `count_hi`, ..., `xyz_there`, `count_events`,
..., `has22`, and `make_brick`) into a `.txt` file and upload it to [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/ODIwNjA3NDA2Mzc1) (do not forget to
hit the submit button).
